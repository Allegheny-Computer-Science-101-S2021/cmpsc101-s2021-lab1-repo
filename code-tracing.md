## Analyze the analyze1.py and the analyze2.py program files and answer the questions provided below. Edit this file by simply replacing the place holder --------- with your answer.
------------------------------------------------
1) What is the final output of the analyze1.py and analyze2.py program? Do not execute the program through your computer! Trace the code manually step by step using paper and pen/pencil. Code tracing is an important skill to be learned to master logical thinking and to advance your knowledge to programming efficient software. By using the space below, answer the question above. 
------------------------------------------------
alpha = ---------
beta =  ---------
------------------------------------------------
2) Analyze the analyze1.py program. List all the values of alpha inside the inner while loop, when the j index value is 3? The value of alpha changes when the indices (i, j) changes. The j value is set to be 3, multiple times in this iterative block. By using the space below, answer the question above. ------------------------------------------------
alpha = [---------]
------------------------------------------------
3) Analyze the analyze2.py program. List all the values of beta inside the inner while loop, when the j index value is 2? The value of beta changes when the indices (i, j) changes. The j value is set to be 2, multiple times in this iterative block. By using the space below, answer the question above. ------------------------------------------------
beta = [---------]
------------------------------------------------
4) Analyze the analyze1.py program. What is the value of alpha inside the outer for loop, when the i index value is 2? By using the space below, answer the question above. ------------------------------------------------
alpha = ---------
------------------------------------------------
5) Analyze the analyze2.py program. What is the value of beta inside the outer for loop, when the i index value is 2? By using the space below, answer the question above. ------------------------------------------------
beta = ---------
